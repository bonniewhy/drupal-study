WHAT IS A CONTENT ENTITY?
-- A "content entity" (or more commonly, "entity") is an item of content data, which can consist of text, HTML markup, images, attached files, and other data that is intended to be displayed to site visitors.
-- Content entities are grouped into "entity types" which have different purposes and are displayed in very different ways on the site.
-- Most entity types are also divided into "entity sub-types", which are divisions within an entity type to allow for smaller variations in how the entities are used and displayed.

-- Common entity types:
    -- See table: https://drupalize.me/tutorial/user-guide/planning-data-types?p=3076
    -- comments, pages, sidebar blocks, forms, user profiles, etc.

WHAT IS A FIELD?
-- Within entity items, the data is stored in individual "fields", each of which holds one type of data, such as formatted or plain text, images or other files, or dates.
    -- vendor name, logo, website URL, description, etc.
