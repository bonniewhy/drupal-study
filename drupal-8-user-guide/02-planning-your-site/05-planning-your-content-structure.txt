GOAL: Make a plan for the content structure of the site (which type and subtype of entity to use for which content), and which pages will contain listings of content.

STEPS:
1. Brainstorm about what content your site needs to contain, which could include content that visitors would be looking ofr, as well as content that you want to show to visitors.
2. For each identified piece of content, decide which content entity type would be the best fit. In doing this, you'll need to consider where and how the content will be used and edited on the site.
3. Within each content entity type you identified, decide what division into entity sub-types would make sense.
4. For each entity sub-type you decided on, decide what fileds are needed.
5. Decide on what entity listings are needed, which could be entire pages or smaller areas on the page. For each listing, you'll need to determine what entity items should be listed. THen you'll need to decide in what order and with what filtering options they should be displayed.
6. For each identified field on each entity subytpe, identify what type of data it should contain (such as plain text, formatted text, a date, an image file, etc.), and how many values should be allowed.
7. Consider what fields would be best as references to taxonomy term entities: fields whose values should be chose from a list of allowed values. Allowed values that are expected to change and grow over time, are good candidates.
8. Consider which fields should reference other content entities.
