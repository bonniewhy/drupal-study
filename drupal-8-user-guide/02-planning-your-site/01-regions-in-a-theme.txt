WHAT IS A REGION?
-- Besides its primary con3ent, a web page contains other content such as site branding (site name, slogan, and logo), navigation and aids (menus, links, and icons), formatted text, and images.
-- Each theme provides a set of named regions, such as "Header", "Content", and "Sidebar".
-- The available regions depend on the theme design. Only the "Content" region is required.
