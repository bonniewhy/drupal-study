WHAT IS THE PAGE CACHE?
-- The software that runs your site, on each page request, must perform calculations and retrieve data from the database, in order to compose the page that is sent to the web browser or other application that is accessing the site.
-- These calculations take time, which can mean that your page load time is longer than would be desirable.
-- The system includes the core Internal Page Cache and Dynamic Page Cache modules, which do not require any additional server software; they use a "database cache" mechanism to speed up your site.
-- The way these modules work is that during page calculations, intermediate results and the final page output are stored in a database area (known as the cache). Then the next time a compatible request is made, intermediate or final results, as appropriate, can be retrieved and used rather than redoing the entire calculation.
-- These caching modules normally work reasonably well, and offer at least some speed-up for most sites.
-- Sometimes the page cache can have problems:
    -- Corrupted data in the cache, leading to garbled or incorrect page output
    -- Old data remaining in the cache too long, leading to outdated page output
    -- Insufficient caching, leading to slow page loads

WHAT OTHER DATA IS CACHED?
-- Even if you don't have the cache modules installed on your site, the software that your site runs will still cache the output of many internal calculations:
    -- The theme system caches information in the database cache about which template files are used to render various types of data.
        -- If you are developing a new theme and add a new template file, you'll  need to clear the cache to have your theme file recognized.
    -- CSS and JavaScript files can optionally be optimized and compressed (depending on your site settings). If so, the compressed versions are stored in the file system so that they don't have to be re-optimized too often.
        -- If you are developing a module or theme, you may need to either turn off or clear this file cache to have changes to CSS or JavaScript files be recognized.
     -- The system locates certain low-level PHP functions and classes, such as "hook implementation" and "plugin classes", from your installed modules and stores information about which module has which functionality.
        -- If you are develop a new module or adding features to an existing module, you may need to clear this cache to have your new features be recognized.
