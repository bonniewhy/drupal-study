WHAT ARE USERS?
-- Anyone who visits your website is a "user", including you.
-- Three groups of users:
    -- not logged in, or "anonymous users"
    -- logged in, or "authenticated users"
    -- administrative user account that was automatically created

WHAT ARE PERMISSIONS?
-- The ability to do actions on your site (including viewing content, editing content, and changing configuration) is governed by "permissions".
-- Each permission has a name and covers one action or small subset of actions.

WHAT ARE ROLES?
-- Rather than assigning individual permissions directly to each user, permissions are grouped into "roles".
-- It is a good practice to create several roles on your site.
