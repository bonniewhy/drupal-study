WHAT ARE DEVELOPMENT SITES?
-- Development sites are different copies of the same site used for developing, updating, and testing a site without risking the integrity of the live site.

-- Example deployment workflow:
    -- Local environment: Start with devleopers working on new features, bug fixes, theming, and configuration in their local environment.
    -- Development site: Developers push changes they've been working on to the development site. For a team of more than one developer, version control is usually used.
    -- Staging site:
        -- Can be used for testing, or presenting changes to the client for approval. QA (quality assurance) and UAT (user acceptance testing) are most often carried out on the staging site.
    -- Production site:
        -- The live site on the web available to visitors.

 -- Based on the project's size, scope, requirements, or stakeholders, stages from the above workflow can be removed, or additional stages can be added.
