WHAT ARE FORMS AND WIDGETS?
-- The content management system software that your site is running allwos administrators to edit content and configure sttings online, using various web "forms".
-- "Content editing forms" are used to edit your site's content, and they are configurable by administrators.
-- "Settings configuration forms" are provided by modules and cannot themselves be configured.
-- A widget defines the method used to enter the data for the field.

-- Your site's content is stored in one or more fields that are attachd to the content type and/or sub-type.
-- When you configure the content editing form for each content sub-type, you can:
    -- Select a widget for each field.
    -- Configure widget settings.
    -- Hide one or more fields from the editing form.
    -- Reorder the fields.

-- In principle, you can also have multiple content editing forms available for each content sub-type. This feature is rarely used.
    -- The only exception in common use is for the user profile fields: you can use different forms for user registration and user editing.
