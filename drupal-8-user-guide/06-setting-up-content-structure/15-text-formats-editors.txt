WHAT ARE TEXT FORMATS AND FILTERS?
-- "Text formats" change how HTML tags and other text are processed and displayed on your site. THey are composed of a series of "filters" each of which transforms the text.
-- When users create content, a text format is associated with the content, and the full, original text is stored in a database. The content is then passed through the filters in the text format before being displayed.
-- The core Filter module provides text format functionality, and the core Standard installation profile sets up Basic HTML, Restricted HTML, and Full HTML text formats.

WHAT ARE THE EDITORS ASSOCIATED WITH TEXT FORMATS?
-- Each text format can be associated with an editor, such as a visual WYSIWYG HTML editor.
-- The core Text Editor module provides the ability to associate editors with text formats, and to configure the editors (such as adding and removing buttons from their toolbars).
-- The core CKEditor module provides the industry-standard editor known as CKEditor, so that it can be used to edit HTML content on your site.

WHAT IS CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING?
-- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability typically found in websites.
-- A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to login as another user. It is important to configure the text formats of your website to prevent such abuse.
