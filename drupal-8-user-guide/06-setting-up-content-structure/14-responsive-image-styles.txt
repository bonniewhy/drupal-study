WHAT ARE RESPONSIVE IMAGE STYLES?
-- The core Responsive Image module provides responsive image styles.
-- Allow you to have images in your website that are specifically sized for different screen sizes.
-- This is useful, for example, to make your site load faster on mobile devices because image sizes are optimized for smaller screens.

-- A responsive image style is a mapping between images styles and breakpoints.
-- Breakpoints are the points where a responsive design needs to change in order to respond to different screen sizes.
-- Responsive image styles can only be used if the breakpoints are defined in the theme.
