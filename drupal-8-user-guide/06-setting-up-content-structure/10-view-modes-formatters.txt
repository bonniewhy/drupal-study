WHAT IS A VIEW MODE?
-- How an entity (such as content, a user or a command) is displayed, depends on the context    in which it is shown known as a "view mode".
    -- EX:
        -- a full page of content with all the field values
        -- a teaser of the content with a thumbnail image and a "Read more" link
        -- a full user profile with a zoomable portrait photo
        -- a user avatar with username and link to the profile

-- View modes can be configured through the administration pages.
-- In each view mode, all fields can be hidden or displayed, and if they are displayed, you can choose and configure the filed formatter.
-- A "field formatter" is a setting for displaying the field values.
